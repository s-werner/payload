# payload
 Code for the payload of a model rocket

 This program reads to an SD card and prints to the console (for testing/debugging) the
 - voltage/current of payload electronics
 - Temperature of payload
 - Altimeter data
 - GPS data
 - Angular and linear acceleration of the payload

Code will also turn on buzzer on the test stand indicating system is good for launch and
when payload lands for ease of recovery.
